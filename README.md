# COVID-19 X-ray Image Classification

Developed during the Computer Vision class, this project serves as a practical application of my skills in building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying COVID-19 from X-ray images. The primary focus of this project is to accurately differentiate between COVID-19 positive and negative cases using medical imaging data.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust model for the automatic detection of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled X-ray images and leverages deep learning techniques to achieve high classification accuracy.

### Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques such as normalization, data augmentation, and resizing are applied to prepare the X-ray images for model training.
- **Model Architecture**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed and implemented using TensorFlow/Keras, specifically tailored for image classification tasks.
- **Training and Validation**: The model is trained on a dataset of X-ray images, with a portion of the data reserved for validation to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.
- **Performance Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its reliability in a real-world scenario.
